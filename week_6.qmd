I was assigned to the group at the very last moment & they had already decided on the topic "Jakarta - Sinking City". So, I gave my inputs and completed my part of the presentation and presented in the last week of Term-2. We first prepared the draft presentation on "Microsoft Slides" and then finally moved to Xaringan.
