# Summary

## What is Remote Sensing, you ask?

Remote sensing is like Earth's Personal Observer, capturing information from afar. NASA defines Remote Sensing as acquiring information from a distance -  @earthdata-website2019 . Also, @cdi_wiley_ebooks_10_1002_0471783390_ch1_ch1 define remote sensing as "the acquisition of information about an object without being in physical contact with it”. All this is achieved through sensors mounted on satellites, planes, drones, etc.

## Types of Sensors ?

Remote sensing employs two main types of sensors: Passive and Active. 

**Passive sensors** rely on sunlight reflected off the Earth's surface. However, they are susceptible to interference from elements like clouds and atmospheric haze. 

**Active sensors**, on the other hand, emit signals directed towards the Earth, which bounce back to the satellite sensor. This allows active sensors to operate effectively at night and even penetrate through cloud cover, enhancing their versatility. 

The choice between passive and active sensors depends on the specific environmental conditions and the type of data required for remote sensing applications. A basic difference of the two is shown in the below image explicitly
