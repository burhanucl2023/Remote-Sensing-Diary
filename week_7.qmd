## Summary

Classification in remote sensing is the process of sorting pixels in images to label them, which is essential for tasks such as monitoring urban green spaces or combating illegal logging in forests, and other land uses. This week's lecture focused on classification in remote sensing and its implementation using machine learning techniques.Machine learning methods discussed include classification and regression trees (CART), random forests, maximum likelihood, and support vector machine (SVM). The lecture also covered supervised and unsupervised image classification approaches. Each classification method has its own principles and considerations, such as the need for human knowledge in expert systems, the use of decision rules in maximum likelihood classification, and the margin optimization in SVM. Considerations include whether to classify pixels or objects, the selection of the appropriate machine learning model, and the determination of necessary hyperparameters.

### Classification and Regression Trees (CART)?

-   It creates a hierarchical model composed of nodes and branches. Nodes signify decision points, while branches represent outcomes. At the end of the hierarchy, leaf nodes contain predicted values for the target variable.

**YAY'S**

-   Classification and regression trees implicitly perform feature selection.
-   Outliers have no meaningful effect on CART.
-   It requires minimal supervision and produces easy-to-understand models.

**NAY'S**

-   Overfitting.
-   High Variance.
-   Low bias.
-   Structure may be unstable.

### Random Forest?

-   Random forests use many decision trees together. Each tree is made from a different part of the data, and their predictions are combined to give a final answer. This helps overcome any mistakes from individual trees, making the overall result more accurate.
-   Random forests are better than single decision trees because they are more flexible, accurate, and easier to use. They're great for both classifying things and predicting values, making them a top pick in machine learning. Basically, random forests make decision trees work better by teaming them up, resulting in better performance overall.

**YAY'S**

-   Provide high accuracy in both classification and regression tasks.
-   Robust to overfitting
-   Suitable for a wide range of tasks, including handling both numerical and categorical data.

**NAY'S**

-   Random forests can be more complex to interpret
-   Training a random forest can be computationally expensive and require significant memory.
-   Optimizing hyperparameters for random forests can be challenging and time-consuming.
-   May not perform well with very small datasets due to the risk of overfitting and limited diversity among trees.

## Applications

For this week, I explored the used of Classification and Regression Trees (CART) and Random forests (RF) using Google Earth Engine. Here are my results for both CART & RF Classification, after using the Sentinel-2 Data provided by GEE and applying it to Srinagar City. For, this exercise I identified three types of landcovers - water, urban and forest. Further, I filtered the data for the year 2020 and limited the satellite images with less than 20% cloud cover and then obtained a composite image by using the median function.

-   **RF Classification:**

-   **Difference between CART & RF**

After this to get a holistic view of the difference between the two, I obtained the difference layer and it could be seen in the difference image that Random Forest wrongly identified the central part of Dal Lake as Forest while as Classification and Regression Trees (CART) did a good job there as it identified it as water. In this "Black" denotes the similar classification by CART and RF while as "Yellow" denoted mismatch between the two.

## Reflections

This week was a lot of important topics and it explored the intricacies of machine learning for informed decision-making, even if the technical details are difficult to grasp. I will be revising this lecture and will be using these techniques in Google Earth Engine in near future. While doing the Classification analysis, I was able to obtain an interesting thing. I compared the CART Classification of Srinagar City for the year 2015 and for the year 2020 and I was able to deduce the following:-

-   There have been massive campaigns in the city to protect the [Dal Lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dal_Lake) (also called the "Srinagar's Jewel" ) and it could be seen in the area designated as "A" in the image below that in 2015, a portion of the lake has been identified as a vegetation/forest by our model indicating pollution in the lake while the same patch is shown as water in 2020, so clearly indicating that the efforts by the state government to clean the lake have somewhat succeeded.
-   Also, it is also to be noted that in the area designated as "B" there has been lost of forest cover and increase in the urban cover, indicating the urban expansion of city from the north-west side.
