**Gratitude:** *As I was away for the first five weeks, so had to catch up a lot in a small amount of time. But, I would like to express my gratitude to my department (in general) and Dr Andrew MacLachlan (in particular) for guiding me through this and I hope I have managed to produce a good learning diary and met the expectations of my peers.*
