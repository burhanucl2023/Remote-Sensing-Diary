Yeah, we are famous for **Beautiful Valleys, Mesmerizing Lakes, Cashmere Shawls & Wazwan (our local cuisine)**. Take a glimpse of my hometown through this [Photo Gallery](https://stock.adobe.com/uk/search?k=kashmir)

I am a Passionate Urban Spatial Enthusiast pursuing postgraduate studies at **University College London (UCL)**, blending expertise in Urban Spatial Sciences and Civil Engineering.

I have held mid-level management positions in both government and the public sector, specializing in the strategic development of road networks for underserved areas in India. Beyond that, I've played a pivotal role in contributing to the dynamic landscape of the Oil & Energy Sector in India. My mojo revolves around crafting the future of transportation design, playing with spatial analytics, rocking disaster management scenarios, championing net-zero strategies, and setting the stage for cool public policies. Committed to driving positive change, seeking collaboration with like-minded professionals to shape a more sustainable future for cities and regions.
