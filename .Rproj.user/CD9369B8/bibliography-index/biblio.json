Synthetic aperture radar data acquired from the Italian COSMO-SkyMed satellite were processed and analyzed. Specific applications included sinkhole detection in karst terrain, slope stability monitoring, and infrastructure assessment. A 40 x 40 km Area of Interest was identified in the proximity to the City of Staunton, in a region geologically prone to sinkhole formation. Satellite data from this area were acquired on a bi-monthly schedule, for a period of 14 months. Radar data were processed with the SqueeSAR algorithm. Additional software tools for automated sinkhole detection were developed. A new approach involving Temporary Coherent Scatterer (TS) was experimented with. Study results indicate that satellite radar remote sensing can be effectively applied to performance monitoring of transportation infrastructure.",

            "abstract": "This study introduces change detection based on object/neighbourhood correlation image analysis and image segmentation techniques. The correlation image analysis is based on the fact that pairs of brightness values from the same geographic area (e.g. an object) between bi‐temporal image datasets tend to be highly correlated when little change occurres, and uncorrelated when change occurs. Five different change detection methods were investigated to determine how new contextual features could improve change classification results, and if an object‐based approach could improve change classification when compared with per‐pixel analysis. The five methods examined include (1) object‐based change classification incorporating object correlation images (OCIs), (2) object‐based change classification incorporating neighbourhood correlation images (NCIs), (3) object‐based change classification without contextual features, (4) per‐pixel change classification incorporating NCIs, and (5) traditional per‐pixel change classification using only bi‐temporal image data. Two different classification algorithms (i.e. a machine‐learning decision tree and nearest‐neighbour) were also investigated. Comparison between the OCI and the NCI variables was evaluated. Object‐based change classifications incorporating the OCIs or the NCIs produced more accurate change detection classes (Kappa approximated 90%) than other change detection results (Kappa ranged from 80 to 85%).",

            "abstract": "The advantages of object-based classification over the traditional pixel-based approach are well documented. However, the potential limitations of object-based classification remain less explored. In this letter, we assess the advantages and limitations of an object-based approach to remote sensing image classification relative to a pixel-based approach. We first quantified the negative impacts of under-segmentation errors on the potential accuracy of object-based classification by developing a new segmentation accuracy measure. Then we evaluated the advantages and limitations of object-based classification by quantifying their overall effects relative to pixel-based classification, with respect to their classification units and features at multiple segmentation scales. The results based on a QuickBird satellite image indicate that (1) segmentation accuracies decrease with increasing segmentation scales and the negative impacts of under-segmentation errors become significantly large at large scales and (2) there are both advantages and limitations in using object-based classification, and their trade-off determines the overall effect of object-based classification, which is dependent on the segmentation scales.",

            "abstract": "During the first week of September 2014, the Jammu and Kashmir region witnessed devastating floods across the majority of its districts, caused by multi-day heavy rainfall events. According to data provided by the Home Ministry of India, several thousand villages across the state were hit and 390 villages completely submerged. The preliminary assessment of property damage was estimated between INR 50,000 million to INR 60,000 million. Approximately 277 people died. In this study, an effort was made to analyze the heavy rainfall events over Jammu and Kashmir using hourly data at the fine spatial scale from satellite remote sensing. Data over Jammu and Kashmir reveal strong diurnal variation in rainfall over the severely affected districts. Most of these districts experienced continuous frequent heavy rainfall rates in the range of 15–22 mm/h during the first week of September 2014. The results show that the cumulative rainfall during 2–6 September 2014 may have contributed to the flood events.",

            "abstract": "The main objective of this study is to apply an object-based image analysis (OBIA) approach to satellite image processing and determining crop residue cover (CRC) and tillage intensity. To achieve this goal, we collected ground truth data using line-transect method from 35 plots of farmlands with an area of 528 ha. Accordingly, Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) satellite image together with global positioning system (GPS)-based survey data set were considered for applying the OBIA methods and deriving CRC. To process the data, object-based image processing steps including segmentation and classification were applied to develop intelligent objects and establish classification using spectral and spatial characteristics of CRC. We developed three categories of rule sets including mean indices, tillage indices, and grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) texture features using the OBIA algorithms and assign class method. Results were validated against of ground control data set and were collected by GPS in field survey. Results of this study indicated that the brightness, normalised difference tillage index, and GLCM texture feature mean performed out as effective techniques. Overall accuracy and kappa coefficient (κ) were computed to be about 0.91 and 0.86; 0.93 and 0.90; 0.60 and 0.35, respectively, for the above-mentioned indices. The foregoing discussion has attempted to demonstrate that the remotely sensed data can be effective approach and substitute for ground methods, especially in large areas.",

            "abstract": "As countries become increasingly urbanized, understanding how urban areas are changing within the landscape becomes increasingly important. Urbanized areas are often the strongest indicators of human interaction with the environment, and understanding how urban areas develop through remotely sensed data allows for more sustainable practices. The Google Earth Engine (GEE) leverages cloud computing services to provide analysis capabilities on over 40 years of Landsat data. As a remote sensing platform, its ability to analyze global data rapidly lends itself to being an invaluable tool for studying the growth of urban areas. Here we present (i) An approach for the automated extraction of urban areas from Landsat imagery using GEE, validated using higher resolution images, (ii) a novel method of validation of the extracted urban extents using changes in the statistical performance of a high resolution population mapping method. Temporally distinct urban extractions were classified from the GEE catalog of Landsat 5 and 7 data over the Indonesian island of Java by using a Normalized Difference Spectral Vector (NDSV) method. Statistical evaluation of all of the tests was performed, and the value of population mapping methods in validating these urban extents was also examined. Results showed that the automated classification from GEE produced accurate urban extent maps, and that the integration of GEE-derived urban extents also improved the quality of the population mapping outputs.",

            "abstract": "Landslide hazards in hilly areas are causing destructions to properties and lives all around the globe. Increasing population demands for the urbanization of mountainous areas which in turn escalates the risk associated with landslides. In India, the Himalayan belt is highly susceptible to landslides and contributes a major share of the total landslides across the world every year. Rainfall is identified as the major triggering factor of landslides in Indian Himalayas, and this chapter summarizes the case study conducted to establish an early warning system for Kalimpong town, in the Darjeeling Himalayas of India. Different approaches in defining rainfall thresholds were followed and real time field monitoring has been carried out using Micro Electro Mechanical (MEMS) tilt sensors and volumetric water content sensors. The study proves that the rainfall thresholds can be used as a first line action for issuing early warning to the public and its performance can be improved by using real time monitoring data.",

            "abstract": "Shoreline mapping using satellite remote sensing images has the advantages of large-scale surveys and high efficiency. However, low spatial resolution, various geometric morphologies and complex offshore environments prevent accurate positioning of the shoreline. This article proposes a semi-global subpixel shoreline localization method that considers utilizing morphological control points to divide the initial artificial shoreline into segments of relatively simple morphology and analyzing the local intensity homogeneity to calculate the intensity integral error. Combined with the segmentation-merge-fitting method, the algorithm determines the subpixel location accurately. In experiments, we select five artificial shorelines with various geometric morphologies from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data. The five subpixel artificial shoreline RMSE results lie in the range of 3.02 m to 4.77 m, with line matching results varying from 2.51 m to 3.72 m. Thus, it can be concluded that the proposed subpixel localization algorithm is effective and applicable to artificial shoreline in various geometric morphologies and is robust to complex offshore environments, to some extent.",

            "abstract": "This study developed an analytical procedure based upon a spectral unmixing model for characterizing and quantifying urban landscape changes in Indianapolis, Indiana, the United States, and for examining the environmental impact of such changes on land surface temperatures (LST). Three dates of Landsat TM/ETM+ images, acquired in 1991, 1995, and 2000, respectively, were utilized to document the historical morphological changes in impervious surface and vegetation coverage and to analyze the relationship between these changes and those occurred in LST. Three fraction endmembers, i.e., impervious surface, green vegetation, and shade, were derived with an unconstrained least-squares solution. A hybrid classification procedure, which combined maximum-likelihood and decision-tree algorithms, was developed to classify the fraction images into land use and land cover classes. Correlation analyses were conducted to investigate the changing relationships of LST with impervious surface and vegetation coverage. Results indicate that multi-temporal fraction images were effective for quantifying the dynamics of urban morphology and for deriving a reliable measurement of environmental variables such as vegetation abundance and impervious surface coverage. Urbanization created an evolved inverse relationship between impervious and vegetation coverage, and brought about new LST patterns because of LST’s correlations with both impervious and vegetation coverage. Further researches should be directed to refine spectral mixture modeling by stratification, and by the use of multiple endmembers and hyperspectral imagery.",

            "abstract": "This study developed an analytical procedure based upon a spectral unmixing model for characterizing and quantifying urban landscape changes in Indianapolis, Indiana, the United States, and for examining the environmental impact of such changes on land surface temperatures (LST). Three dates of Landsat TM/ETM+ images, acquired in 1991, 1995, and 2000, respectively, were utilized to document the historical morphological changes in impervious surface and vegetation coverage and to analyze the relationship between these changes and those occurred in LST. Three fraction endmembers, i.e., impervious surface, green vegetation, and shade, were derived with an unconstrained least-squares solution. A hybrid classification procedure, which combined maximum-likelihood and decision-tree algorithms, was developed to classify the fraction images into land use and land cover classes. Correlation analyses were conducted to investigate the changing relationships of LST with impervious surface and vegetation coverage. Results indicate that multi-temporal fraction images were effective for quantifying the dynamics of urban morphology and for deriving a reliable measurement of environmental variables such as vegetation abundance and impervious surface coverage. Urbanization created an evolved inverse relationship between impervious and vegetation coverage, and brought about new LST patterns because of LST’s correlations with both impervious and vegetation coverage. Further researches should be directed to refine spectral mixture modeling by stratification, and by the use of multiple endmembers and hyperspectral imagery.",

            "abstract": "The development of robust object-based classification methods suitable for medium to high resolution satellite imagery provides a valid alternative to “traditional” pixel-based methods. This paper compares the results of an object-based classification to a supervised per-pixel classification for mapping land cover in the tropical north of the Northern Territory of Australia. The object-based approach involved segmentation of image data into objects at multiple scale levels. Objects were assigned classes using training objects and the Nearest Neighbour supervised and fuzzy classification algorithm. The supervised pixel-based classification involved the selection of training areas and a classification using the maximum likelihood classifier algorithm. Site-specific accuracy assessment using confusion matrices of both classifications were undertaken based on 256 reference sites. A comparison of the results shows a statistically significant higher overall accuracy of the object-based classification over the pixel-based classification. The incorporation of a digital elevation model (DEM) layer and associated class rules into the object-based classification produced slightly higher accuracies overall and for certain classes; however this was not statistically significant over the object-based using spectral information solely. The results indicate object-based analysis has good potential for extracting land cover information from satellite imagery captured over spatially heterogeneous land covers of tropical Australia.",
