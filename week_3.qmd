## Summary

### Corrections

Remotely sensed data requires corrections to remove flaws which may be due to various factors like - atmosphere, sensor sensitivity, illumination conditions, distortions due to viewing angle,topographic conditions,etc.

**- Atmospheric Correction:** It removes flaws caused in the remotely sensed data due to atmosphere.The atmosphere affects the incoming sunlight thereby leading to reflection, scattering and absorption of various parts of electromagnetic spectrum. Atmospheric correction is either relative or absolute. Relative atmospheric correction adjusts the data based on radiance values of target area with respect to neighboring area, while as, in absolute atmospheric correction we convert digital brightness values into scaled surface reflectance. This allows us to directly compare these scaled surface reflectance values across different regions of the planet, facilitating accurate analysis and interpretation of Earth's surface characteristics and changes over time.

**- Geometric Correction:** Geometric correction involves adjusting remotely sensed data to account for image distortions introduced by various factors such as the view angle (off-nadir), topography (e.g., non-flat terrain), wind (in aerial acquisitions), and the rotation of the Earth (in satellite imagery). This correction ensures that the satellite image aligns accurately with a coordinate reference system.

**- Topographic Correction:** It deals with the effect of terrain variations on reflectance values.It requires sensor geometry and elevation data. After incorporating it, the accuracy and consistency of remote sensing data improves across different terrain conditions.

**- Radiometric Correction:** This correction accounts for sensor-related factors such as variations in sensor sensitivity, illumination conditions, and atmospheric effects, ensuring that the resulting data accurately represents the physical properties of the observed features.

## Applications

This week's session focused on rectifying raw satellite images, merging them, and enhancing their quality, particularly delving into the significance of atmospheric corrections in satellite image studies. It's crucial to recognize that satellite images often suffer from distortions due to various factors which were discussed above, and these can compromise the accuracy of our analysis. To mitigate these distortions, the corrections are routinely applied as a prerequisite before conducting analysis. These corrections ensure that the images are properly aligned and scaled, laying a reliable groundwork for subsequent interpretation and extraction of meaningful data.

I stumbled upon a research paper by @hassan2006b, where they delve into examining how changes in the number of Ground Control Points (GCPs) and the degree of mapping polynomials affect the accuracy of the geometric correction process. They utilized the Root Mean Square Error (RMS) at the chosen GCPs to gauge the accuracy of their findings. The study revealed that employing a higher degree of polynomial rectification alongside an increased number of GCPs resulted in elevated RMS errors.

Similarly, the same image was corrected by using 16 Ground Control Points as shown below.

For the practical, I again used the Google Earth Engine to obtain NDWI map of Srinagar. The Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) is used to highlight open water features in a satellite image, allowing a water body to “stand out” against the soil and vegetation.The NDWI index was proposed by McFeeters in 1996. Its primary use today is to detect and monitor slight changes in water content of the water bodies. Taking advantage of the NIR (near-infrared) and GREEN (visible green) spectral bands, the NDWI is capable of enhancing the water bodies in a satellite image. The downside of the index is that it is sensitive to built structures, which can lead to overestimation of water bodies @2021 .The "white" colour denotes water and the rest of the region of the map is in "black". It is clearly visible that the famous "Dal Lake" and the Lifeline of Kashmir "The River Jhelum" is in white.

## Reflections

As I joined the Term quite late, so had to catch up with all in a short amount of time. But, as the lectures and the practical notebooks were crafted perfectly, so I was able to grasp most of the concepts. Regarding, this week, I understand the importance of covering corrections, despite their initial complexity, to ensure data quality and facilitate comparison between different images. Exploring how remotely sensed images can be manipulated reveals deeper layers of information beyond the surface data. Although I didn't do the practical exercises this week, but I have gone through the code and have also checked the @ahmad as recommended & I found it valuable and I anticipate revisiting it in future.
