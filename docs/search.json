    "text": "2.1 What is Remote Sensing, you ask?\nRemote sensing is like Earth’s Personal Observer, capturing information from afar. NASA defines Remote Sensing as acquiring information from a distance - Earthdata-Website (2019) . Also, Elachi and van Zyl (2006) define remote sensing as “the acquisition of information about an object without being in physical contact with it”. All this is achieved through sensors mounted on satellites, planes, drones, etc.\n\n\n\nSpace Satellite GIF by NASA - GIPHY (n.d.)"

    "text": "2.2 Types of Sensors ?\nRemote sensing employs two main types of sensors: Passive and Active.\nPassive sensors rely on sunlight reflected off the Earth’s surface. However, they are susceptible to interference from elements like clouds and atmospheric haze.\nActive sensors, on the other hand, emit signals directed towards the Earth, which bounce back to the satellite sensor. This allows active sensors to operate effectively at night and even penetrate through cloud cover, enhancing their versatility.\nThe choice between passive and active sensors depends on the specific environmental conditions and the type of data required for remote sensing applications. A basic difference of the two is shown in the below image explicitly\n\n\n\nDifference between passive and active sensors for remote sensing. Image © “The Nature Conservancy” (n.d.)"

    "text": "2.3 Electromagnetic Spectrum ?\nRemote sensing is based on the principle that there is always an interaction between electromagnetic radiation and an object.Electromagnetic waves travel through the air and space, each with different wavelengths and frequencies. Some waves, like radio and infrared, have long wavelengths, while others, such as ultraviolet and x-rays, have short wavelength. Human eyes can only see a small part called visible light.\nDifferent types of radiation operate in various parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. Sensors can read different wavelengths, thus providing diverse information. Earth’s atmosphere blocks most wavelengths, allowing only radio waves, visible light, and some infrared. Instruments, like passive sensors in the optical window and active sensors using radio waves, help us understand our surroundings.\n\n\n\nElectromagnetic Spectrum, Source Earthdata-Website (2019)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarthdata-Website. 2019. “What Is Remote Sensing? | Earthdata.” Backgrounder.
