    "text": "2 Summary\nRemote sensing data finds numerous applications across diverse fields. It is used in agriculture for optimizing uses of fertilizers, prediction of crop yields,measuring soil moisture content, monitoring droughts, assessment of crop health, etc.\nSimilarly, in forestry it can be used for monitoring forest cover, tracking deforestation & controlling forest fires.Also, remote sensing is being used for checking the rapid urbanization, planning road networks, pre and post disaster preparedness & in many more fields.\nAlso, during my research regarding the use of remote sensing, I came across one of the works which discussed the application of remote sensing in route planning for road projects in challenging terrain (Mishra (2015)). This study delved into the effectiveness of remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in mapping road infrastructure in rugged landscapes. Various factors influencing road network construction and the resolution of associated challenges were examined within a specific context. Criteria encompassing major and subsidiary factors were assessed to select an appropriate model for comparing attributes and grading them based on their significance. All these examples together demonstrate how valuable remote sensing technology is across a wide range of fields.\nTransitioning from a Civil Engineering background to the realm of spatial science, particularly remote sensing, has been a thrilling journey. One notable application that resonates with me, especially concerning India, is the utilization of remote sensing for identifying “Unconnected Habitations.” These are isolated dwellings or small clusters of houses situated in regions lacking road access, electricity, and water supply. Typically nestled in mountainous terrains, these areas are predominantly inhabited by tribal communities. So, by leveraging remote sensing technology we could identify these remote settlements, facilitating the formulation of targeted policies aimed at fostering development within these underserved regions."

    "text": "2.1 What is Remote Sensing, you ask?\nRemote sensing is like Earth’s Personal Observer, capturing information from afar. NASA defines Remote Sensing as acquiring information from a distance - Earthdata-Website (2019) . Also, Elachi and van Zyl (2006) define remote sensing as “the acquisition of information about an object without being in physical contact with it”. All this is achieved through sensors mounted on satellites, planes, drones, etc.\n\n\n\nSpace Satellite GIF by NASA - GIPHY (n.d.)"

    "text": "2.2 Types of Sensors ?\nRemote sensing employs two main types of sensors: Passive and Active.\nPassive sensors rely on sunlight reflected off the Earth’s surface. However, they are susceptible to interference from elements like clouds and atmospheric haze.\nActive sensors, on the other hand, emit signals directed towards the Earth, which bounce back to the satellite sensor. This allows active sensors to operate effectively at night and even penetrate through cloud cover, enhancing their versatility.\nThe choice between passive and active sensors depends on the specific environmental conditions and the type of data required for remote sensing applications. A basic difference of the two is shown in the below image explicitly\n\n\n\nDifference between passive and active sensors for remote sensing. Image © “The Nature Conservancy” (n.d.)"

    "text": "2.3 Electromagnetic Spectrum ?\nRemote sensing is based on the principle that there is always an interaction between electromagnetic radiation and an object.Electromagnetic waves travel through the air and space, each with different wavelengths and frequencies. Some waves, like radio and infrared, have long wavelengths, while others, such as ultraviolet and x-rays, have short wavelength. Human eyes can only see a small part called visible light.\nDifferent types of radiation operate in various parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. Sensors can read different wavelengths, thus providing diverse information. Earth’s atmosphere blocks most wavelengths, allowing only radio waves, visible light, and some infrared. Instruments, like passive sensors in the optical window and active sensors using radio waves, help us understand our surroundings.\n\n\n\nElectromagnetic Spectrum, Source Earthdata-Website (2019)"

    "text": "3.1 Corrections\nRemotely sensed data requires corrections to remove flaws which may be due to various factors like - atmosphere, sensor sensitivity, illumination conditions, distortions due to viewing angle,topographic conditions,etc.\n- Atmospheric Correction: It removes flaws caused in the remotely sensed data due to atmosphere.The atmosphere affects the incoming sunlight thereby leading to reflection, scattering and absorption of various parts of electromagnetic spectrum. Atmospheric correction is either relative or absolute. Relative atmospheric correction adjusts the data based on radiance values of target area with respect to neighboring area, while as, in absolute atmospheric correction we convert digital brightness values into scaled surface reflectance. This allows us to directly compare these scaled surface reflectance values across different regions of the planet, facilitating accurate analysis and interpretation of Earth’s surface characteristics and changes over time.\n- Geometric Correction: Geometric correction involves adjusting remotely sensed data to account for image distortions introduced by various factors such as the view angle (off-nadir), topography (e.g., non-flat terrain), wind (in aerial acquisitions), and the rotation of the Earth (in satellite imagery). This correction ensures that the satellite image aligns accurately with a coordinate reference system.\n- Topographic Correction: It deals with the effect of terrain variations on reflectance values.It requires sensor geometry and elevation data. After incorporating it, the accuracy and consistency of remote sensing data improves across different terrain conditions.\n- Radiometric Correction: This correction accounts for sensor-related factors such as variations in sensor sensitivity, illumination conditions, and atmospheric effects, ensuring that the resulting data accurately represents the physical properties of the observed features."
